# What is Props in React?

    In ReactJS, the props are a type of object where the value of attributes of a tag is stored. The word “props” implies “properties”, and its working functionality is quite similar to HTML attributes.

    Basically, these props components are read-only components. In ReactJS, the data can be passed from one component to another component using these props, similar to how the arguments are passed in a function. Inside the component, we can add the attributes called props; however, we cannot change or modify props inside the component as they are immutable.
